Name: Majorie Delafeu

Physical description :
 thin medium size, she usually wears dresses with flower motives and likes hats. Most of the male students in purbety (and some of her colleagues too) like to look at her ass (which she is aware of, could we focus on the lesson, thank you very much !)
She has a very good ear-memory (which is, in a socety based on listening, a very good thing)

Magical talent :
minor enchanting, never trained beyond the minimum control

Family
- probably has parents, but undetermined for now

background :
Fascinated by history and how the society came to "be" she studied hard and wanted to be a researcher in history. Early on the discovered that the blocus on science woudl cover up many episodes of the history of the country. Her loud mouth nearly got her into trouble : she wanted the truth, and to tell it; it would not sit well with the authority. After being interogated by the Anti-Science Police (ASP?), she resigned from research and went into teaching. There she hoped to open the mind of the next generations enough that the world would stop fearing science and such things.

Story wise :
Major role in first part, minor role as the story goes on
she is our main "world explanation" character

At the beginning of the story, she has a few years of teaching behind her, changed schools twice and feel quite good where she is now (middle society school, not too riched people, but neither poor, classes before the magical test : between 8 and 12 ?)
She has a group of friends she meets every week for tea or diner and some chat (might also be a way to open our story)

She is the one who finds her neighbor killed (the third or fourth death, moment when the police is finally making the links that it is one killer)
her previous research might put her under suspicion by the police

She is our starting point for the story : 
- her neighbor is one of the murdered person
- she teaches the class with the "magical kid from the science family"
- she allows us to introduce the universe and its history 
- we can see the magical test through her eyes (but the magical kid from scinece 's test would be later than the beginning of the story)
