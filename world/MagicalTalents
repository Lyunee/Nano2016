Magical Talents are in a few different categories (listed below). A person can cumulate more than one talents. The most usual is one or two talents, three being rare and four being the stuff of legends. The usefulness of a parson's talents is thus measure with two criterias : the combinaison of talents, and the strength of each.

There is little ambiant magical energy, so spell/enchantment energy usually comes from a source. It has not yet been found how to store such energy once it is made and that is  a long time reasearched subject (with loads of failures, more or lesss explosive)

- source : create magical energy within themselves. Most source are trained to give this energy to other who can "wave" the spells or the enchantments. Some rare cases happen when a source can not share that energy. Some people thus considere the ability to give and receive an additional talent.

- caster : can weave spells. A spell last only for a short time (as oposed to enchantment). Spells is the most explored subjects and ranged wide in their complexity and in the level of energy require
strong caster can handle both a large amount of energy and the complexity of the harder spells.

- enchanter : can enchant an object. Enchantments last depending on the quality of the object and the quality of the enchantment itself. The strongest advancment in that is the discovery of the pattern (also called runes) that would allow an enchantmeetn to be fed energy by any source. This "recent" discovery really opened the field of wild enchanting. (though previous enchantment could be seen as a way to store energy it would actually have no "switch" a "lamp" would keep being lighted until energy runs out, and energy put into the lamp could not be drawn out and used)

- shaper : uses magical energy to mold materials. Quite a rare talent, some spell have been created to fill in the gap this lack of talent had made (and lack of science). for example : cutting stones, cutting woods, lightening fires ...

- sensor : can "feel" magical energies or remanents of magical energies. Very rare, they often linked their magical sense to another sense (vision, smell, ear ...) they can feel where magical energy was used, and the most sensitive of them can distinguish between magical signatures (though the reliability of this information is uncertain).
