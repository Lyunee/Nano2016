Name: Majorie Delafeu

Physical description :
 thin medium size, she usually wears dresses with flower motives and likes hats. Most of the male students in purbety (and some of her colleagues too) like to look at her ass (which she is aware of, could we focus on the lesson, thank you very much !)
She has a very good ear-memory (which is, in a socety based on listening, a very good thing)

background :
she wanted to be an history researcher, but came too close to the forbiden subjects for the comfort of some. An interogation about her motivations and her interest was how far she got. Scared she stopped all her research on this time period (the big war and banning of science). SHe instead became a teacher, but was unable to obtained a post at the "university" as her previous subject of research was now a black mark against her
(her teacher and main supporter in her research also mysteriously disappeared a few months after her own interogation. potential guilt about how she might have doomed him, but mostly uncertain)

she teaches the younger generation, but even after years the black mark remains, though no one really care now she actually enjoys the challenge and questions of the younger classes

Major role in first part, minor role as the story goes on
she is our main "world explanation" character

might also be under suspicion for the police

She is the one who finds her neighbor killed (the third or fourth death, moment when the police is finally making the links that it is one killer)

magical talent : minor enchanting, never trained beyond the minimum control
