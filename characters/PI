Name: Darius
Physical description: There is nothing really outstanding about him, which makes his job easier. He is of middle build, fit, but by no means buff. He has brownish-blond, short hair, and is dressed like most of the middle or lower class. He's in the mid of his 30th.. 
Personality: He tends to keep to himself, maybe a result of his job, but he doesn't feel lonely even if he is alone. He's down-to-earth, sees things pragmatic. 
Magical Talent: Source, listening in in conversations, tracking... his talents are wide-spread, but only average strong, though well-trained. 
Job: Private investigator – his office is in the “not so good” part of town, although far from the worst area. His customers belong to the lower class, but also middle class, since he made himself a name of being discreet and fast with his investigations. Occasionally, a higher class customer comes into his office, but those jobs are either dangerous or shady. He often ventures in the grey area of law, sometimes clearly in illegal fields, but he has some things he would never do. 
Family: 
His mother died as Darius was quite young
His father was in the same field of work, and was killed on the job as Darius was 17
Aunt (and her family) live in a village a few hours away, but he seldom visits. His nephews and nieces love him; he can tell nice stories
