“Lady”: Elena
Physical description: She's a beauty in her twenties. Long black hair, pleasant body and face. She has a small tattoo at the back of her neck just below the hair line, which marks her as the Mafia's property.
Personality: She does what she has to do, to survive. There is a tiny spot in her that still hopes for her dreams to come true, for happiness, for family, but she doesn't even believe in it herself. A really pragmatic view on life. 
Magical Talent: No real magic power to mention. Slight ability to make people like her more or make people talk more than they would normally do. An ability that she uses to bind customers to her and the Mafia uses to get information.
Job: She is a whore, working for the Mafia. She is quite good looking, so she is high selling and has it better than other girls. Her ability to pry information out of customers (like business plans...) is seen as valuable. She desperately seeks for another way to be useful, since she can, at most, be in her kind of business for another ten years before being exchanged for younger girls. 
Family: Elena is one of those street kids. If she ever had a family, she doesn't talk about it.
