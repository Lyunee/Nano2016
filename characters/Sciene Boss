Head of Science people: George
Physical description: in his 50s. He starts to become bald, the remaining hair is getting grey from his natural blond. He is of middle build and a bit overweighted (but not too obese.) 
Personality:He has an inventive soul and a sharp mind. He likes to tinker and work on things. His drive to bring science into the world started from trying to make things even for everybody, but turned harsher and rebellious over the passing years. Every backlash in his private life made him just more angry. He's embittered, stern, and he does invent stuff only to prove himself and that science is worth more than any magical talent. 
Magical talent: Basically non-existent. He can use the magical items, but that's all.
Job: It is a low-paying job in a factory for producing heating devices and stoves. He is just allowed to assemble stuff; boring and repetitive work.
History: He grew up in a middle class family. After he failed the test for magic potential, his parents started to dote on his younger brother, who had high magical potential. In his need to show that he is useful, even without magic, he started to invent stuff. His family was appalled, instead of being happy about his inattentiveness. He stopped talking/showing them his inventions, but he never stopped. As soon as he was an adult, he moved away to another town. Stuck in a low-paying job, where no-one valued his work, his drive for inventing and making the world better, slowly turned into a bit vengeful side. (More of a “I will show them!” instead of a “Look what I am able to do, even without magic.”)
Family: 
His father died a few years ago
His mother and brother (with family) are still in their hometown
His wife died a year ago, resulting in him being even more eager to bring science into the world
He has a grown up daughter (already married)
