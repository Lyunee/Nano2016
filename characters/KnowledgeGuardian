Name : Edward 

title : Guardian of the Forbiden Knowledge  

Physical description :
man growing old. has a long face with a bald hair (except some hair on the side, that are grey.
he keeps a small beard that acceptuate the long features of his face. Tall and thin (nearly sickly so), he is a well trained caster though not one of the highest power (his source power are slightly under what is necessary for most of the powerful spells)

his role is to know some of the forbiden knowledge and be able to recognise different level of such knowledge. He is also directly responsible for the safe keeping of old science artifacts and the volumes that also go with this knowlledge.

His role is one attributed by the king (or someone in his court), but generally in aggreement with the city (or choosen between candidates)

He takes his role very seriously. Touched to the soul by the attrocities of the "Last" war, but more even scared by the destructive potential of the mixing of knowledge. Scared of how easy it could be once you have the knowledge he dreams of destroying it.

he is a fervent advocate of destructing all the scientific artifacts (which goes against the king policy established after the war : the knowledge must remain, which some says is wise, others think it a way to keep a secret weapon against any potential enemies)

Solo guardian of a forbiden and destructive knowledge he grew old alone and bitter. He persuaded himself of the importance of his role and consider himself a denfenser of the society. He is thus ready to make any "sacrifice" (be it a child's life) considering that even if he is condemned for the "murder" he did what was right for the society
(let us note he also is considering himself at war with those who want to revive science)
