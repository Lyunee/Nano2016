murderer

name : Edward

family : uncarring parents, a bit too many sister and brothers, broke all relation to them a long time ago

history : 
  kinda gifted but never recognised
  he always aimed to be the best, to be acknowledged and seen, but he never succeeded
  always just after those who were great he ended up embrassing that "never seen" side and turned to murder
  insensitive to other's pain, he loves seeing their faces as they die. Then he is acknowledge and seen then finally he feels alive
  
  he has a part-time job in a shop (or restaurant or anything)
  
  he is smart and change his mode of killing every time, also change his target (it would be boring to always do the same thing, I am better than that)
  very carefull to never leave trails, he does not use his magic when he kills so he can not be found by his magical signature
  but he leaves his sign : a half-moon (due to being half seen/always overlooked), which is sometimes interpreted as a sickle (so science and the police thinks it's science related, a message from the science people by killing innocent people.)
