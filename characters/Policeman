Police man: Henrik/Hendrik 
Physical description: He is big and heavy-boned, someone who can throw a punch. His nose is crooked (from a fight in his teens) and as huge as his body, in total, he is not really good looking. He has blond hair and blue eyes. He is around 30. 
Personality: He was taught to follow rules, so that is his first response to a problem. In his job he sees quite a few things belonging to a grey-zone, so his mind-set is slightly changing to be more open-minded. He is working hard, so expects that from other people, too. For him, there is nothing that has no answer, if you can't find one, you haven't searched well enough. 
Job: He worked hard to become part of the anti-science department, one he thinks as important. The department was meant to be a stepping stone, with his father's influence and his own good grades/achievements, he has high hopes of bringing it to the upper levels of the police force. He is not really against science, but he is adamant on keeping the law. The more he sees during his work, though, his mind-set is changing. He starts to see more of the human being and starts to question some decisions of the upper echelon. 
Family: 
Both parents live in the same city (he has a good relationship to them) His father is a higher ranking person in the ministry and strict.
He has a younger sister (by 3 years), currently studying
His girlfriend and him are discussing to move together
