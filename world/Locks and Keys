Lock and Key system: An enchanted lock-crystal. Pale blue for general use. Size of around double the amount of your thumb nail, around the same form. At one end of the oval, there is normally a hole drilled in, so you can tie a string around the lock-crystal and carry it around or easier find it in your bag. It is enchanted for a certain door, for apartment complexes it can be used as key for the front door and then one specific door of one of the apartments. Everybody can use the lock-crystal, so if you lose your lock-crystal, you have to re-enchant the lock at your door and get a new crystal. The lock in your apartment door is enchanted to be only opened by certain crystals, so it is a bit of work to install new doors and locks. It's not that expensive, since it is used quite often, but it is not really cheap either. The enchantments are quite strong and long living, since they don't need that much of energy. Every ten years, it is recommended to renew the enchantments on door and lock-crystal to make sure you don't stand in front of a locked door ;) 
There are personalized lock-crystal and locks, they normally tend to have a slightly more purple hue and are only able to be used by a certain person to a certain lock. Used mostly for high security places, like federal buildings or the storage room for memory bubbles and so on. Higher prized and harder to make.
General remark: lock-crystals are hard to copy. It is possible, but it takes time, a specialized mage, and is expensive, so not really done often. Personalized lock-crystal are almost impossible to copy. There are lock-crystals that are able to overwrite door locks, but you'll always find a magical trace of this. Most door locks are enchanted to give an alarm in cases of forceful or unrightful opening of the door.
