History:
coming from a country side family (dad dead or missing, kind of never talk about him, mother takes care of the farm: animals mostly), she came to the city for her "university" study as a source
not liking what she saw as her futur she re-oriented her studies toward law to finally join the police department
her good records (and some says, her good relations) pushed her to the anti-science departement

She believes in her work, not as "anti-science" but as a "guardian of peace"
