Dad : Yvan
Mum : Laureen
Kid : Manuel
Family name : DAUGHERTY (English. Of Norman origin meaning "from Hauterive", a place name derived from Old French haute rive "high bank".)

The tradtion of science comes from Laureen. As a teenager she was completely rejecting that family tradition (which comes from her father who was leading his scientific cell back then). It is at that time that Yvan and her started to build their friendship and relationship. He one day found out, which made her very afraid for his life and realised how she cared for him (in her mind her father was ruthless in his defence of science, that episode showed her he was also considerate of her feelings and of human lives)

Though she is no cell leader like her father, she found great interst in some research work as she grew older. Yvan's own enthousiasm and curiosity also helped.

His lack of magical Talent had pushed him away from his familly where Talents where foten there by twos and strong. He found within this secret community a place where he could belong and where his ideas were more valued than his lack of magic.

Magical Talents: 
  Yvan : none (rare case in this universe)
  Laureen : source of small power (very often the case in this universe)
  Manuel : strong source and strong caster, might even have a bit of a weak sensor (where would all that comes form ... well, ask genetics ^^ )
